> [!NOTE]
> Tidal playback is supported via widevine and a custom electron version from [castlabs](https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Vermilion runs off of your user token. ***DO NOT*** share it with anyone, as it grants anyone with it access to your account.
>
> It is also not 100% certain that you won't get banned for this, although I haven't heard of anyone getting banned for a 3rd party client on Tidal yet.
