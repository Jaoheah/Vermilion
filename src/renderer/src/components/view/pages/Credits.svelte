        The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br
        />
        development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br
        />
        efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br

        open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br
        />
        with others.<br />
        <br />
        The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br

        names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br />
        however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br />
        requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br />
        to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<br />
        <br />

        <br />
        Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OFL, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font<br
        />
        Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient<br

        files normally.<br />
        <br />
        We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively
        work<br />
        to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks
        to<br />
        learn about Font Awesome.<br />

        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br
        />
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br
        />
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br
        />
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br />
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<br />
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br
        />
        <br />
        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br
        />
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br />
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br />
        <br />
        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br
        />
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br />
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br />
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br />
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br />
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br />
        <br />
        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br />
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br />
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br />
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br
        />
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br />
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br />
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br />
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br />
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br />
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br />
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br />
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br />
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br />
        as of the date such litigation is filed.<br />
        <br />
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br />
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br />
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br />
        meet the following conditions:<br />
        <br />
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br />
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br />
        <br />
        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br />
        stating that You changed the files; and<br />
        <br />
        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br />
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br />
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br />
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br />
        the Derivative Works; and<br />
        <br />
        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br />
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br />
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br />
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br />
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br />
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br />
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br />
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br />
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br />
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br />
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br />
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br />
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br />
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br />
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br />
        as modifying the License.<br />
        <br />
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br />
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br />
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br />
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br />
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br />
        the conditions stated in this License.<br />
        <br />
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br
        />
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br />
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br />
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br />
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br
        />
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br />
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br />
        <br />
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br
        />
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br
        />
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br
        />
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br />
        <br />
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br />
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br />
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br />
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br />
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br
        />
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br />
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br />
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br
        />
        <br />
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br />
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br />
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br />
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br />
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br
        />
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br />
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br />
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br />
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br />
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br />
        <br />
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br
        />
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br />
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br />
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br />
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br />
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br />
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br />
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br />
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br
        />
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br />
        <br />
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br />
